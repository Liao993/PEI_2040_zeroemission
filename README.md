# PEI_2040_zeroemission
PEI is going to move a zero carbon emission community in 2040. One of greenhouse emissions is from household, and thus I am going to analyze it.

The datasets I got were from statisitcs Canada. In the GHG_search.ipynb, I focus on the change of annual carbon emission in PEI household, and the wind energy or soloar power generation in PEI can be seen in windsolar_energy.ipynb.
